            <h3 id="JT-1">Graduation Project Overview</h3>
            <h4><span style="background-color: #E7CCCC;">Purpose of the Graduation Project</span></h4>
            <p>In line with the university’s educational philosophy of "moral and intellectual development, combining theory and practice," our department emphasizes the practical application of knowledge as a goal of the teaching process. To test and demonstrate students' practical abilities, undergraduate students are required to undergo a rigorous graduation project before graduating. Each student must participate in a project team to complete an information-related project. This is only allowed after undergoing multiple exhibitions and rigorous evaluations by faculty and external experts. This system not only serves as a strict assessment mechanism but also helps students consolidate what they have learned, verify their practical skills, and build confidence. Through project development, students learn to execute projects, cultivate teamwork, and enhance problem-solving skills—key abilities often lacking in general university graduates but highly sought after by employers. Implementing the graduation project ensures that students receive essential workplace training before entering society. It also establishes clear academic goals for students starting from their freshman year, reducing confusion.<br><br>
            To evaluate the connection between curriculum and core competencies, as well as their relevance to higher education and employment, the department has created curriculum maps for each group. These maps display the relationship between courses and areas of concern for students’ future education and employment. Each core competency corresponds to specific courses. After completing these courses, students are expected to possess the relevant skills. Based on their career plans, they can choose to pursue further studies or enter the workforce after graduation. In addition to the main courses for core competencies, the department places special emphasis on the "Graduation Project" course, requiring students to form teams and participate, culminating in an exhibition.<br><br>
            Upon admission, students are made aware that they must complete their graduation project from the second semester of their junior year to the first semester of their senior year. This includes a final presentation, exhibition, and report, which provides students with a clear goal during their studies. The process stimulates them to think about their preferred field of research. To perform well in their graduation projects, students are motivated to work harder and ask more questions during their courses. The department also supports outstanding teams to participate in external competitions, offering travel subsidies through office funds.<br><br>
            The department's proudest "Graduation Project" course has been maintained since its founding in 1993 and has been running for 26 years. The course is conducted over two semesters—junior year (second semester) and senior year (first semester). Students form teams of 3–5 members to undertake academic research or develop information systems related to a specific topic. Every November, teams participate in group exhibitions and competitions. Each team is evaluated by three faculty members specializing in the relevant field, who review students' live demonstrations, system operations, and oral presentations. Scores are given based on these criteria. The objective of this training mechanism is to nurture creative graduates with specialized skills. Activities like on-campus paper presentations and prototype demonstrations help foster teamwork and professional skills.<br><br>
            To support the best practical training, each group’s curriculum plan includes foundational knowledge development and practical application training. Under the passionate teaching and strict supervision of the faculty, students can gradually learn and achieve ideal results. This effectiveness is fully reflected in the outcomes of the graduation projects. To enhance learning exchanges and validate students' practical skills, the department encourages students to participate in national-level competitions. Due to the technical, practical, and creative aspects of their projects, students frequently win significant awards in these competitions, bringing annual recognition to the department.<br><br>
            Over the past three years, project focuses have been categorized into four areas: handheld devices, interactive games, information applications, and emerging technologies. The number of participating teams for each category is shown in the table below. Through the graduation project activities, students can apply what they have learned. The judges for the 25th annual competition even included alumni working in related industries, providing students with practical feedback from the industry. Many students have reported gaining valuable insights and a better understanding of industry priorities.</p>

            <h3 id="JT-3">Explanation of Budget Utilization</h3>
            <p>The 'Information Management Department Graduation Exhibition' is an event in which every student in the department participates. The format of the event is also decided collectively by the students. The event is organized by a team of third-year students who are responsible for planning and executing the exhibition.<br>
The revenue for this event comes from both school funding and the collection of fees from third-year students. The preparation team typically refers to previous year's exhibitions and collects funds from the third-year students in advance. The majority of the collected funds are used for the construction of the exhibition venue and evening events, including lighting, sound systems, electrical work, lucky draw activities during the student evening event, performances, and more. After the event concludes, any remaining funds are equally refunded to the students.
<span style="background-color: #C1CFA1;">The event funds are allocated for specific purposes, with a reimbursement system in place. All income and expenditures are managed by designated students, and the financial records are completely transparent. The spending items are reviewed in meetings with student representatives, and guidance is provided by the supervising teacher and department office as needed.</span><br>
The formation and responsibilities of the Information Management Department Graduation Exhibition Preparation Team are as follows: The 'Activity Group' plans the event details, the 'Public Relations Group' invites sponsors, maintains relationships with alumni, and engages cooperating enterprises, the 'Equipment Group' handles venue and equipment borrowing, the 'Exhibition Group' is responsible for venue planning and vendor negotiations, the 'Document Group' takes meeting minutes and prepares reports, and the 'Finance Group' manages bookkeeping, collections, and payments. All funds handled by students are managed by designated individuals and allocated specifically for the event's use.</p>
